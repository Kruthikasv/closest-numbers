CHALLENGES FACED
The project that was assigned to us was quite challenging as the implementation of files concept was new to us as was the concept of using Epoch values. These problems were overcome by browsing about the concepts of files and learning about epoch from various different sources online.

LEARNT FROM ASSIGNMENT
In conclusion, we learnt how to implement and perform operations on a file and this assignment made us think logically and improve our skills in doing so.
